SLAM Simultaneous localization and mappping  
Sensor Lighat based LIdar.  
    . velocity is infered
Radio active base Radar.  
    . velcoity is measured using doppler effect.
    
Gaussian Distribution: is  normal distribution. It follows central limit theorm if we take mean 
of smaple set drawn from indivual independent process, and plot the frequency of events it follows Normal distribution.
As Sample size increase the The ND peaks.

Kalman Filter: Measurement <--> Update Localiztion
    Measurement cycle : Bayes theorem p(a/b) = p(b/a).p(a)/p(b)
    Update :total Prob is convolution
    
EKF: has complex motion models.They measure objects 

RAdar Data:sensor_type, rho_measured, phi_measured, rhodot_measured, timestamp, x_groundtruth, y_groundtruth, 
vx_groundtruth, vy_groundtruth, yaw_groundtruth, yawrate_groundtruth.

Lidar:sensor_type, x_measured, y_measured, timestamp, x_groundtruth, y_groundtruth,
vx_groundtruth, vy_groundtruth, yaw_groundtruth, yawrate_groundtruth.
